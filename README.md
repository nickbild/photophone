# Reviving the Photophone

*Coming soon!*

Believe it or not, the world's first wireless phone call was placed in 1880. I've recreated Alexander Graham Bell's Photophone that made it possible, and you can too.

Alexander Graham Bell will forever be known for inventing the telephone â€” and not much else (although he was a prolific inventor). Despite the success of the telephone, Bell considered the Photophone, which he perfected four years after patenting the telephone, to be his greatest invention. He was right that wireless phones were the future, but as it turned out, the Photophone was not the technology that would take us to that future.
