# Reviving the Photophone

*Coming soon!*

Believe it or not, the world's first wireless phone call was placed in 1880. I've recreated Alexander Graham Bell's Photophone that made it possible, and you can too.

Alexander Graham Bell will forever be known for inventing the telephone — and not much else (although he was a prolific inventor). Despite the success of the telephone, Bell considered the Photophone, which he perfected four years after patenting the telephone, to be his greatest invention. He was right that wireless phones were the future, but as it turned out, the Photophone was not the technology that would take us to that future.

## How It Works

### Principle of Operation

There are two main parts to a photophone, the transmitter and receiver.

| *A transmitter* |

The most notable thing about the transmitter is that it contains no electronics whatsoever. A lens focuses sunlight on a flexible mirror at the end of a tube. When someone speaks into the other end of the tube, it causes the mirror to vibrate. Those vibrations, which encode the speaker’s voice, are then transmitted in the light that reflects off of the mirror.

At the receiver, the light from the transmitter is collected and focused by a parabolic mirror with a selenium cell at its focal point. The selenium cell was an early photoresistor, so as the level of light falling on it varied, so did its electrical resistance. Current was passed through the cell and into an electromagnetic speaker, which turned the variations back into sound.
